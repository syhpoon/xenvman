Overview
=======

xenvman is an extensible environment manager which can be used to
create environments for testing microservices.

Environment is an isolated bubble where one or more containers can be run 
together in order to provide a necessary playground for testing microservises.

xenvman allows you to:

* Define environment templates using JavaScript
* Create images on the fly
* Spawn as many containers as needed inside a single environment
